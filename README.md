## **Experience and Approach** 
  I have good knowledge on basic C , Python , HTML ,CSS, GITHUB. I believe that , with my constant efforts and programming knowledge I can deliver output efficiently.
  I have been working on [Biometric Aunthentication](https://github.com/sajid-sree12/Biometric-Authentication) to reduce the time lag while taking attendance. 90% of Frontend is completed with the help of XML and using Kotlin for Backend.
  The project is pushed into my github repository and I am working on it.
  I am good at python programing and basic knowledge on Data Science with python.

# **About Project**
**Project Status:** Ongoing

**Project Title :** [Present Sir](https://github.com/sajid-sree12/Biometric-Authentication)

**Proposal description:**

  we are facing a time lag issue in our college while taking attendance from students. Mean while we are about to do a project regarding Programing. We thought that if we solve this issue with our skills, it will be useful for both our institution and for our programming career.

**Benefits and Costs**
    
  - Major benefits with this project is reduction of time lag , time consumption will be grealty reduced.
  - And the second benefit is we can monitor students attendece upto date. 
  - We can perform data science operations on the student's attendance.
    
**Implementation Method**

  - The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple text-based format for representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, and much more. 
  - XML was designed to store and transport data so in a sense it's neither frontend nor backend much like HTML. For example, the backend can generate HTML which is passed to the frontend for rendering a webpage.
  - We are using XML language to design interface elements. We are looking for Database for storing fingerprint keys, and work will continue.
  - We selected android studio IDE to develop our application.
  - Our work progress can be observed by clicking on this [hyperlink](https://github.com/sajid-sree12/Biometric-Authentication).

    
    
**Requirements**

  - Good performing Laptop
  - Android studio Software
  - Android Emulator (will be available in Android)
  - Knowlegde about XML,Kotlin and DBMS

**Expected Outcomes**

 All the student data and finger prints will be stored in Database.
 After getting authrization from teacher , student has to confirm date , he can't select previous/future date as we blocked it , then after he/she will place finger on scanner. By default application will findout his roll number and attendance will be alloted to him.
 Output can be accessed in Excel sheet.
